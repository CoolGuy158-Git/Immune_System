  Idk I wanted to create an immune system like AV it's not yet a complete AV
  this is only v.0.1 basically it just shows the concept, the real one is gonna be built 
  on Bash/C/Rust(And maybe python for high level tasks) and 
  is gonna be made for linux so I won't have to deal with windows sh**.

  Anyways I'm trynna find some people to help with it so if you want just dm me or something my discord name is CG158
  anyways its buggy I know when will I fix it? Idk.
